# Experiments with NODE classification on accelerometry data

- `hypothsis` contains bayes hypotheses approach: learn "good" model for each class label, assume each label is equally probable and classify with maximum liklyhood principle
- `vizualizing_trajectories` contains vizualizing of data's phase trajectories based on Takens's theorem
- you can also see `node` package at project's root with generic utilites for data_loading, building trajectories, training, vector fields
